C# API Client for NET2 Software

View And Open Doors That Use Net2 Compatible ACUs


1. Legitimately download the SDK. Used to be available on the office NET2 forums, but you'll now need to email them for access.

2. Install SetupOEM.msi and RedistOEM.msi on the server that has NET2 on it

3. Install  RedistOEM.msi on the client machine

4. Open this .NET project, do "Add References" and add  the dll from C:\Program Files (x86)\Reference Assemblies

(On windows 11 I had to rename the redistOEM.msi to a zip file and extract with 7 zip to get the dll)


5. Run project
